I have always had a passion for scientific outreach and discovery, and since completing my degree in Physics I have worked both professionally and on a voluntary basis with a number of organisations, delivering entertaining and rigorous science communication to both adult and young audiences.

I have received professional training from the Royal Institution and mentorship with Great Scott! Productions. In addition to presenting, I have voluntary experience in programming science communication at Green Man Festival, Cambridge Science Festival, and Cheltenham Science Festival.
