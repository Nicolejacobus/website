In addition to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/current-work/science-communication/" class="">science communication</a>, I speak on both personal interest topics and in institutional settings on behalf of the organisations I represent. I am a confident public speaker with experience developed through stage performance (Oxford University Dramatic Society) and expert mentorship.

Additionally, I have been performing as drag king Jack Knife since 2018, performing at a number of acclaimed drag shows - including Kings of Clubs (Royal Vauxhall Tavern, London), Slaystation (The Glory, London), Camp Cabaret (The Glory, London), Haute Mess (The Bullingdon, Oxford), and SPUDS (Jericho Taven, Oxford) - as well as at corporate and family-friendly Pride events. I performed internationally at the Oxford/Cambridge Varsity Ski Trip in December 2019.

Both Nicole and Jack Knife are available for public speaking and performance engagements!
