As a co-founder of the <a href="https://immersiveexperience.network/">Immersive Experience Network</a>, we are working to develop a collaborative hub for the immersive experience and entertainment sector, helping the industry reach its full potential in terms of commercial growth, access, and opportunities for creative cross-pollination.

My role comprises: co-ordinating and managing our series of live events, both our large-scale Summits and networking Huddles, supporting funding streams through producing high-quality grant applications and seeking opportunities for sponsorships, managing our digital presence, and producing academic and commercial research.

The IEN is constantly evolving and is always looking for new partnerships, sponsors, and industry professionals looking to join the network and share their experience. Please do <a href="mailto:contact@immersiveexperience.network">get in touch</a> if you're interested in finding out more.
