I work with <a href="https://entourage.live/">Entourage</a> as a production manager, providing creative solutions primarily in the immersive sector as well as for brand and PR events.

On a given project, I oversee the full timeline from sourcing a venue to opening: feasibility and logistical planning, budgeting, design phase management, meeting creative goals with practical solutions, and managing onsite work including builds, de-rigs and live events. I am highly proficient with project management tools including time planning through Gantt charts, agile task management including Kanban strategising, visual and technical design layouts in Vectorworks CAD software. I am a qualified SMSTS Site Manager and have IOSH Managing Safely and First Aid at Work certifications.


I am also the producer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths">Stand-Up Maths</a>, a maths communication YouTube channel with over 1.2M subscribers.

My role includes co-ordinating multiple video release timelines, as well as associated collaborations, sponsorships, product releases and live events. I also manage the channel's Patreon page and audience relationships.

As a freelance project manager, I have worked on a variety of exciting live events, including currently as Event Manager for <a href="https://festivalofthespokennerd.com/show/an-evening-of-unnecessary-detail/">An Evening of Unnecessary Detail</a>, and previously as Stage Manager for <a href="https://www.foxandbadge.com/">Fox & Badge</a> and Logistics Co-ordinator for <a href="https://www.burningnest.co.uk/">Burning Nest</a>.
