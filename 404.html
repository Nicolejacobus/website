  <p><strong>Here's an AI-generated poem about being lost and found:</strong></p>
  <p>In the digital realm where pathways entwine,
A lost soul wanders, seeking a sign.
404, a digital divide,
In the vast expanse, where shadows hide.</p>

<p>A pixelated wilderness, a path unknown,
Like sheep astray, far from home.
Yet, fear not, for there's a guiding hand,
A shepherd's grace to help you stand.</p>

<p>In the digital scriptures, a tale unfolds,
Of errors and glitches, as history molds.
But fear not, lost one, for in the code,
Redemption awaits on the digital road.</p>

<p>Like the Prodigal Page, you may have strayed,
But grace awaits in every pixel laid.
For in the vast expanse of cybernetic land,
The lost are found, by a helping hand.</p>

<p>So, rest assured, weary traveler of the bytes,
404 is but a pause in your digital flights.
For in this realm, where zeroes and ones abound,
You'll be found again, on solid ground.</p>
