# Nicole Jacobus


Iâ€™m a Creative Producer and enthusiasm enthusiast based in London.

I primarily work as a project/production manager and producer in live events and immersive experiences, as well as for YouTube channels. I also perform, produce prints, and communicate science by commission and on a freelance basis.

Outside of work, you can find me training aerial silks, volunteering with Jewish community organisations, or teaching myself the accordion.

<a href="mailto:hinicole@jacobus.org">Get in touch</a> to find out more about my work or get me involved in your projects. I'm always open to discussing new opportunities.
