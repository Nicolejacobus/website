    Iâ€™m a Creative Producer and enthusiasm enthusiast based in London.<br><br>

    I primarily work as a project/production manager and producer in live events and immersive experiences, as well as for YouTube. I also perform, create prints, and communicate science - by commission and on a freelance basis.<br><br>

    Outside of work, you can find me training aerial silks, volunteering with community organisations, or teaching myself the accordion.<br><br>

<a href="mailto:hinicole@jacobus.org">Get in touch</a> to find out more about my work or get me involved in your projects. I'm always open to discussing new opportunities.
